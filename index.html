    <p>Hi Sara,

How is your life going?
How was your birthday? Did you celebrate it?
Did you receive my gift? Probably you have bin it straight away?

Recently I saw a dream with you. We were going on the bus together and speaking a lot. I was asking you how your life changed since you have divorced as we have met with you exactly when you had a spiritual awakening and life change. How is it actually feels? What new came into your life? What about you living now?

Sara, maybe we can still stay friends just to talk and meet sometimes. As in general I very like your personality. And quite sad and maybe in some way silly to forget each other for forever. It's like open a very interesting book and after just scare it and through it away.
I saw quite a decent tea place in the city centre called "Richmond Tea Rooms".
Maybe you would wish to meet there?

I moved recently. Now I live even closer to work. Now I live on Stretford road. And got a bicycle so it is so much quicker to get me to work as it was before. I even wonder how much time I was using before, now it takes only 10-15 minutes to get to work apart the previous time of 1.5 hr.)))))) Even don't know why I chose that place on Walkden maybe just because it was a very nice flat there.)))

Sara, reply to me at least something.
Don't be dead.))))))))))
Vic.</p>
